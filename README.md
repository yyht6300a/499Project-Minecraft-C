***What would teaching AI and ML to middle schoolers look like?***

Teaching middle schoolers AI and ML topics with Minecraft Education will help introduce students to the world of computer science. Minecraft Education is available on many different platforms, such as Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, iPadOS, and Android, which many students have access to in North America. The middle school age is a great time to teach students Python, instead of block-based programs like Scratch. Students will use Python to interact with the world around them and apply general AI and ML topics to solve problems that matter to them. They will play in their own worlds, with their teacher around to offer them guidance. The math skills of middle schoolers are mostly limited to trigonometry and algebra, and so the lessons will not go too deep into AI and ML concepts. Importantly, the goal is not to have students write full AI and ML programs from scratch, but rather to introduce them to AI and ML topics and terminologies.

Game aspect: The user wants to kills monsters at night to protect their character, they can do that through an algorithm that recognizes monsters and protects villagers. ML aspect: image recognition, the student needs to make sure that they train the algorithm unbiasly. 

AI and ML are based on computer science and programming, but the student in middle school may not know what python is, and in elementary school there are a lot of students using Block-base programming language like Scratch. Therefore, how to help middle school students to switch from Scratch to Python can be a good point in our project.

translate the block-based code to python code. E.g. make the python code as a password of a treasure box in the game and set the block code as password prompt. user can find the comparison table for block code and python code somewhere in the game.
